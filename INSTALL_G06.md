### 📝 INSTALL_G06.md (Draft for Validation)

#### Step 1: Python Environment Setup
We use Conda to ensure a clean, isolated environment to avoid conflicts with other MACAD projects.

**1. Open VS Code Terminal (`Ctrl + ò`) and navigate to the project folder:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\giofo\Desktop\ARCHIVIO\MASTERS\MACAD\2_MACAD\0_MACAD DRIVE\AIA\STUDIO\hypergraph_G06-AIA-studio"
```

**2. Create and activate the Conda environment:**
```bash
# Create environment forcing Python 3.9 (required for compatibility)
conda create -n aia_hypergraph python=3.9 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate aia_hypergraph
```

#### ⚠️ Troubleshooting: "conda is not recognized as an internal or external command"
If you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed but VS Code's PowerShell terminal doesn't recognize the `conda` command, or if it throws a red error when trying to activate the environment, you need to initialize Conda for PowerShell and allow script execution.

**Fix Step 1: Initialize Conda**
1. Close VS Code.
2. Open the Windows Start Menu, search for **"Anaconda Prompt"** (do NOT use the standard cmd or PowerShell yet), and open it.
3. Run this command to configure PowerShell:
```bash
# Initialize Conda for Windows PowerShell
conda init powershell
```
4. Close the Anaconda Prompt.

**Fix Step 2: Allow Script Execution (Windows Only)**
Windows often blocks the `activate.ps1` script required to switch Conda environments.
1. Open Windows **PowerShell** as **Administrator** (Right-click > Run as Administrator).
2. Run this command and press `Y` when prompted:
```powershell
# Change the execution policy to allow local scripts to run
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Fix Step 3: Restart and Verify**
1. Re-open **VS Code** and open a new terminal (`Ctrl + ò`).
2. You should now see `(base)` appearing on the left side of your terminal prompt. This means Conda is successfully hooked to VS Code! You can now proceed with Step 1 of the installation.

> **✅ Validation Check 1:** Run `python --version` in the terminal. It MUST return `Python 3.9.x`. If it returns a different version, the environment is not active.

#### Step 2: Installing Dependencies
Now we install the required packages. To ensure the packages are installed safely into the active environment, we use `python -m pip`. 

**1. Run the installation command:**
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**2. Missing Dependency Fix:**
The original `requirements.txt` file is missing several packages, which are strictly required for visualizing graphs in the Jupyter Notebook. Install them manually with this command:
```bash
python -m pip install networkx pydot plotly scikit-learn "numpy>=2.0" pandas --upgrade
```

> **✅ Validation Check 2:** Let's test if the core libraries (including the .NET bridge for Rhino) installed correctly. Run this in your terminal:
> ```bash
> python -c "import clr; import fastapi; import networkx; print('Dependencies installed successfully!')"
> ```
> If it prints the message without errors, your Python environment is perfectly set up.

#### Step 3: Link VS Code to the Conda Environment
Even if you installed everything correctly in the terminal, you must tell VS Code to use the `aia_hypergraph` environment, otherwise it will use your system's default Python and throw `ModuleNotFoundError`s.

**1. Open the Command Palette:**
Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).

**2. Select the Interpreter:**
Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and hit Enter.

**3. Choose the Conda Environment:**
From the dropdown list, look for the one named `aia_hypergraph` (it should say something like `Python 3.9.x ('aia_hypergraph': conda)`). Click on it. 
*(If you don't see it, click on the refresh icon in the top right of the dropdown menu).*

**4. Jupyter Kernel Selection:**
When you open the `notebooks/visualize_hypergraph.ipynb` file, look at the top right corner of the notebook window. If it doesn't say `aia_hypergraph`, click on the current kernel name, choose "Select Another Kernel...", click "Python Environments", and select your `aia_hypergraph` Conda environment.

---

#### Step 4: The C# DLLs Configuration (CRITICAL)
Rhino and Grasshopper require these compiled libraries to run the hypergraph algorithms. Windows blocks downloaded `.dll` files by default, which causes Grasshopper components to turn red and fail.

**1. Create the target folder:**
Ensure the folder `.\dlls\main` exists in your workspace.

**2. Copy and Unblock:**
Instead of unblocking them one by one manually (which is prone to human error), use this PowerShell command inside VS Code to copy and unblock everything automatically:

```powershell
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".\dlls\main"

# Copy all DLLs from the repository to .\dlls\main
Copy-Item -Path ".\samples\_requiredDLLs\*" -Destination ".\dlls\main" -Recurse

# Unblock all copied DLLs (Crucial step for Rhino/Grasshopper)
Get-ChildItem -Path ".\dlls\main" -Recurse | Unblock-File
```
> **âœ… Validation Check 3:** Go to `.\dlls\main`, right-click on one of the `.dll` files, select "Properties". If you **do not** see the "Unblock" (Annulla blocco) checkbox at the bottom, it means the script worked perfectly and the files are safe to use.



#### Step 5: Environment Variables & Database Configuration

**1. Create the `.env` file:**
In VS Code, look at the root folder of your project. You should see a file named `.env.example`. 
Copy and paste it, then rename the copy to strictly `.env` (with the dot at the beginning).
Open the `.env` file and make sure it contains this exact line:
```env
API_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**2. Create the Database File:**
Before running the server, the `RGeoLib` C# library requires a database directory and JSON file to exist.
Run this in your VS Code terminal to create them:
```powershell
# Create the folder and an empty JSON array
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".\database"
Set-Content -Path ".\database\database.json" -Value '[]'
```

#### Step 6: Running the Local API
Now we launch the backend server using Uvicorn. This server must be running in the background whenever you want to test your Jupyter Notebooks or make API calls.

**1. Launch the Server:**
To start the FastAPI server, run this command in your terminal (`aia_hypergraph` environment must be active):
```bash
# Launch the API with hot-reloading enabled
uvicorn api.main:api --reload
```

**2. Validation Check (The Final Test):**
- Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`
  *(You should see a raw JSON response)*.
- Then, go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
  *(You should see the Swagger UI documentation page showing all the available endpoints for your hypergraph project).*

> **⚠️ Important Note:** Leave this terminal running! Do not close it or press `Ctrl+C` while you are working in `notebooks/demo.ipynb` or generating hypergraphs, because the notebook needs to communicate with this local server. To stop the server when you are done working, click inside the terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

#### Step 7: Running the Jupyter Notebook
Now that the backend server is running, you can execute the hypergraph algorithms via Python.

**1. Open the Notebook:**
In VS Code, navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open `demo.ipynb` (or `visualize_hypergraph.ipynb`).

**2. Select the Kernel:**
Ensure the active kernel in the top right corner is set to `aia_hypergraph`.

**3. Fix the JSON Path (If Needed):**
Since executing from the root of the workspace, you may get a `FileNotFoundError` for the JSON dataset. In the cell that loads `pd.read_json()`, update the string to explicitly call the correct child path:
```python
df = pd.read_json('notebooks/src/sample_hypergraphs.json')
```

**4. Run All Cells:**
Click the **"Run All"** button at the top of the notebook. The cells will send requests to your local API (running on port 8000) and generate the outputs or graph visualizations directly below each cell.

> **⚠️ Important Note:** Ensure the terminal running `uvicorn` (from Step 6) remains open and active in the background while you work in the notebook!


#### Step 8: Rhino/Grasshopper Validation
Now we verify if the CAD software correctly reads our setup.

1. Open **Rhino 7**.
2. Open the file: `samples\Hypergraph Reference Script 1 Transfer Layout via Hypergraph.3dm`
3. Launch **Grasshopper** and open the corresponding `.gh` file.
> **✅ Validation Check 4:** Look at the Grasshopper canvas. Are there any **Red components** (especially the C# script nodes)? 
> - If **NO**: The installation is 100% successful! 🎉
> - If **YES**: The C# component failed to load the DLLs. Double-check that the files are actually in `.\dlls\main` and properly unblocked.
